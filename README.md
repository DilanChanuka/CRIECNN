CRIECNN: Ensemble convolutional neural network and advanced feature extraction methods for the precise forecasting of circRNA-RBP binding sites

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have surfaced as important non-coding RNA molecules in biology. Understanding interactions between circRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial in circRNA research. Existing prediction models suffer from limited availability and accuracy, necessitating advanced approaches. In this study, we propose CRIECNN (Circular RNA-RBP Interaction predictor using an Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network), a novel ensemble deep learning model that enhances circRNA-RBP binding site prediction accuracy. CRIECNN employs advanced feature extraction methods and evaluates four distinct sequence datasets and encoding techniques (BERT, Doc2Vec, KNF, EIIP). The model consists of an ensemble convolutional neural network, a BiLSTM, and a self-attention mechanism for feature refinement. Our results demonstrate that CRIECNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and performance, effectively predicting circRNA-RBP interactions from both full-length sequences and fragments. This novel strategy makes an enormous advancement in the prediction of circRNA-RBP interactions, improving our understanding of circRNAs and their regulatory roles.
